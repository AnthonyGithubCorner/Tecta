# Tecta
A C++ game made from scratch using the SDL2 library

# SDL2 libraries used:
- SDL2_Image
- SDL2_TTF

# How To Play
The goal of the game is to place as many tiles as you can. You lose if you can no longer place tiles. You can place tiles on any tile that is yellow.

However, each tile gives a specific yield, libraries give science, temple (L shaped buildings with the an antenna) give religion, museums (tall purple buildings) give lore, markets (tall yellow buildings) give economic and residential buildings (cross shaped buildings) give food

Throughout the game what your population wants will change and you must meet the yield requirment to keep them happy as shown at the bottom text. ex) Food: # food produced / # food required

If they get too angry with you they will rebel and you can no longer place buildings adjacent

Thats all have fun!
